**Appello GenAI Home Assignment**


I designed both solutions using a 5-layer architecture pattern (Input → Orchestration → Model → Guardrails → Output) with vendor agnosticism, graceful degradation, and observability built in from the start — never retrofitted. 

Every component was treated as a replaceable unit behind an adapter interface, and evaluation (golden datasets, LLM-as-judge, human feedback loops) was planned as a first-class concern rather than an afterthought. 

Delivery was structured as incremental phases — Foundation → Core → Extended Features → Hardening → Pilot → Production — to manage risk and capture feedback early.

_In case of **Task A** I choose the **custom solution**._
